# EAC-Scanner
Scans your C drive and registry for any files pertaining to EAC.
This code scans a root directory (C:) and its subdirectories for files with certain extensions and in certain folders, as well as registry keys in certain hives, and stores the results in a list. The list of file extensions to search for, folder names to search for, registry keys to search for, and registry hives to search in are all specified. The code then iterates over the files in the root directory and its subdirectories and checks if their extensions and locations match the search criteria. It also iterates over the registry hives and subkeys, searching for keys with names that match the search criteria. Finally, the code writes the results to a text file called "EasyAntiCheat_files_and_registry_keys.txt".
